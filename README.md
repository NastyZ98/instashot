# instashot

Instashot is a react-native's application based on Expo. Instashot allow you to take a picture and send it directly on a public Nodejs server also based on express & multer.

This project was born from my desire to learn a little bit more expo's components such as the Camera and the Image manipulation.

My code can literally be improved but I did this in one afternoon.
Take what you want in all these pasta.
